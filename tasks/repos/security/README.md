# Security Vulnerability Detection and Fixing

## Scenario
A web application with common security vulnerabilities that need to be identified and fixed.

## Issues to Fix
1. SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in user input handling
3. Path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
4. Insecure password storage and authentication
5. Command injection vulnerabilities
6. Improper input validation and sanitization

## Success Criteria
- All SQL injection vulnerabilities fixed with parameterized queries
- XSS vulnerabilities mitigated with proper output encoding
- Path traversal prevented with proper path validation
- Secure password hashing implemented
- Command injection prevented with input validation
- All security tests pass
