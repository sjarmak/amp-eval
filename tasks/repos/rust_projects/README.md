# Rust Projects Refactoring Challenges

## Scenario
Rust applications with common refactoring needs including error handling improvements, trait extraction, lifetime management, and async/await implementation.

## Issues to Fix
1. Replace panics with proper Result error handling
2. Extract traits from concrete implementations
3. Improve lifetime management and borrowing
4. Convert blocking operations to async/await
5. Implement proper error types with thiserror

## Success Criteria
- No panic!() calls in production code
- Traits properly extracted and implemented
- Lifetime annotations are correct and minimal
- Async operations properly implemented
- Error handling follows Rust best practices
- All tests pass with improved safety
