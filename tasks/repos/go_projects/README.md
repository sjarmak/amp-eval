# Go Projects Refactoring Challenges

## Scenario
Go applications with common refactoring needs including interface extraction, error handling improvements, and goroutine management.

## Issues to Fix
1. Extract interfaces from concrete implementations
2. Improve error handling with proper error wrapping
3. Refactor large functions into smaller, testable units
4. Implement proper context handling for goroutines
5. Add proper struct validation and JSON tags

## Success Criteria
- Interfaces properly extracted and implemented
- Error handling follows Go best practices
- Functions are properly sized and testable
- Context is properly propagated
- All tests pass with improved coverage
