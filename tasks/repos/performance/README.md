# Performance Optimization Challenge

## Scenario
A data processing application with various performance bottlenecks that need optimization while maintaining correctness.

## Issues to Fix
1. Inefficient O(nÂ²) algorithm in data processing
2. Memory leaks in file processing
3. Unoptimized database queries (N+1 problem)
4. CPU-intensive operations that can be parallelized
5. Poor caching strategies

## Success Criteria
- Improve algorithm time complexity
- Reduce memory usage
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper caching
- All tests pass with better performance metrics
