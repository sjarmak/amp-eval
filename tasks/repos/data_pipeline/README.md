# Data Pipeline Class Renaming Challenge

## Scenario
A data processing pipeline with poorly named classes and methods that need systematic renaming for better clarity and maintainability.

## Issues to Fix
1. Rename `DataProcessor` to `ETLPipeline` 
2. Rename `process()` method to `run_pipeline()`
3. Rename `DataHandler` to `DataTransformer`
4. Rename `handle()` method to `transform()`
5. Update all references and imports across multiple files

## Success Criteria
- All classes and methods renamed consistently
- All imports updated
- All tests pass with new names
- Documentation updated
