üöÄ Amp Model-Efficacy Evaluation Suite: Production Deployment Plan
You've successfully built the evaluation framework foundation. Now implement this roadmap to transform it into a production-grade, organization-wide benchmarking platform.

üìã Phase 1: Foundation Hardening 
Priority 1.1: Testing & Validation

# Add comprehensive test coverage
mkdir tests/
# Create unit tests for amp_runner.py model selection logic
# Add integration tests for each evaluation YAML
# Implement golden-file regression tests for grading consistency
Priority 1.2: Configuration Robustness

Replace string parsing in _evaluate_rule() with proper Boolean expression parser (asteval or jsonlogic)
Add pydantic schema validation for agent_settings.yaml
Implement structured logging with loguru (timestamp, eval_id, model, tokens, success)
Priority 1.3: Token Accuracy

Replace chars/4 estimation with tiktoken or official tokenizer
Add token budget enforcement with clear exception messages
Implement per-call and aggregate token tracking
üì¶ Phase 2: Packaging & Dependencies (Week 2)
Convert to proper Python package:

# Create pyproject.toml with entry points
# Restructure as src/amp_eval/ layout
# Add console script: amp-eval CLI wrapper
# Pin all dependency versions
# Publish to internal PyPI/TestPyPI
Development Standards:

Pre-commit hooks: black, ruff, mypy
100% type hints coverage
No print() statements (structured logging only)
üîÑ Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline 
GitHub Actions Workflow:

# Stage 1: Lint + Unit Tests
# Stage 2: Smoke Evaluation (3 smallest tasks)
# Stage 3: Nightly Full Matrix (Sonnet-4, GPT-5, o3)
# Artifacts: results/YYYY-MM-DD/*.json
# Upload to S3/GCS for metrics lake
Automation Requirements:

Self-hosted runners for cost control
Results stored in time-series format (CSV/Parquet)
Failed runs trigger immediate alerts
üìä Phase 4: Dashboards & Alerting 
Convert Jupyter notebook to production service:

Streamlit web dashboard
Real-time metrics: accuracy trends, token efficiency, latency histograms
Slack/Teams webhooks for regression alerts
PR comment integration with performance diffs
Alert Conditions:

KPI drops below threshold (>5% accuracy loss)
Unexpected model upgrades (>10% increase in o3 usage)
Token budget overruns
üèóÔ∏è Phase 5: Infrastructure & Secrets 
Containerization:

# Alpine Python with minimal dependencies
# Non-root user, security scanning
# Runtime: ECS Fargate or Kubernetes Jobs
Security & Rate Limiting:

OpenAI keys from AWS Secrets Manager/Vault
Exponential backoff with jitter
Global circuit-breaker for cost protection
Fine-grained IAM policies
üìà Phase 6: Dataset Expansion 
Add Phase-2 Evaluation Suites:

Multi-file refactoring scenarios
Performance optimization benchmarks (measure runtime improvements)
Security vulnerability detection (SQL injection, path traversal)
Cross-language support (JS/TS, Go, Rust)
Real-World Alignment:

Convert top 20 support tickets to evaluation prompts
Mirror actual PR patterns from your codebase
Industry-standard coding challenges
üîß Phase 7: Extensibility 
Plugin Architecture:

# BaseModelRunner interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, Local-GGUF
# Custom grader plugins: grader.py next to each YAML
# Dynamic evaluation loading and model switching
Future-Proofing:

A/B testing framework for new models
Custom metric definitions
Evaluation suite versioning
üí∞ Phase 8: Governance & Cost Controls (Ongoing)
Financial Monitoring:

Monthly cost reports by model and evaluation suite
Quota enforcement with budget limits
Token usage trends and optimization recommendations
90-day audit log retention (PII-free)
üìö Phase 9: Documentation & UX (Ongoing)
Developer Experience:

VS Code devcontainer with pre-loaded evaluation environment
Contribution guidelines with cost impact assessment
Dashboard interpretation guide
Model addition tutorial
üéØ Phase 10: Launch Strategy
Rollout Plan:

Internal Beta (Core ML/tooling teams)
Feedback Integration 
Org-wide Launch (Engineering Slack integration)
Post-launch Optimization (performance review)
‚ö° Immediate Next Steps (Start Today)
Install testing framework: pip install pytest pytest-cov
Create tests directory and write first unit test for select_model()
Add pydantic validation to agent_settings.yaml loading
Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
Run first evaluation to generate baseline results
Success Metrics:

TO DO: 90% test coverage, zero config validation errors
TO DO: Automated nightly runs with dashboard
TO DO: Multi-language evaluation support
TO DO: Production v1.0 with org-wide adoption
This roadmap transforms your evaluation suite from prototype to production-grade platform that continuously monitors model performance, catches regressions, and guides future AI investments.
